 Login and Registration form using html,css and javascript:
       Here the user need to provide nessasary login credentials and on clicking the login button the user can see a pop up message showing "Login suucessful" .Similarly if the user not already registered, then he/she can got to registration page and need to provide their account details and finally  user will get a pop message for successful registration .I have created two html files each for login and registration and given  a link from first file to second one using anchor tags.
